# nvimconfiguration
My own nvim configuration

In the best case you only need to copy the nvim folder to your ~/.config/ folder.

If you encounter errors these are most likely because the CLI tools might be missing on your system, e.g., if you have problems with the treesitter plugin, make sure the treesitter-CLI tools are installed. Ask your favourite AI on how to do that for your system.

Have fun!
